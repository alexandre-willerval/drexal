Dev of my personal website

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for 
development and testing purposes, just clone the current Github repository.
```
mkdir site_alex
git clone https://github.com/alexandre-willerval/drexal/ site_alex
```

If you want to recreate the same full dev environment as I have, you can add a "startbootstrap-resume" directory.
```
cd site_alex
mkdir startbootstrap-resume
git clone https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume startbootstrap-resume
```
